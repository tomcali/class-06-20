Make sure you have the Java sdk installed
Download Android Studio
Install the 23.0.1 sdk from Android studio by going to tools -> Android -> sdk manager -> launch standalone sdk manager (you might need Java preinstalled for this) and then downloading it.
Create a new application and keep hitting “next” until you're finished.
Go to Tools -> AVD manager -> create an image (emulator) of your choice.
Download and run watchman (brew install watchman)
In your .bashrc or .bash_profile, have the following set up:
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/your-username/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/sdk/tools:$PATH
Initialize a React-native app with “react-native init nameOfApp ”
In your Android folder within your app that you just made, create a file called “local.properties” and add the following line: sdk.dir=/Users/your-username/Library/Android/sdk
Run the emulator from AVD manager in Android studio by clicking the play button on the device list.
Run the Android application by going to your app in the terminal and typing “react-native run-android”
